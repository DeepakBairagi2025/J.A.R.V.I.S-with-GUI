Deepak Bairagi : Green monitor testing.
J.A.R.V.I.S : To test a green monitor, you can use the following methods:
1. **Color Temperature Test**: Check the monitor's color temperature settings and adjust it to a neutral setting (around 6500K) to see if the colors appear accurate.
2. **Color Gamut Test**: Test the monitor's color gamut by displaying a color chart or a color gradient to see if the colors are accurately reproduced.
3. **Blue Light Emission Test**: Use a tool like f.lux or Iris to measure the blue light emission of the monitor.
4. **Contrast Ratio Test**: Check the monitor's contrast ratio by displaying a black and white gradient to see if the blacks are truly black and the whites are truly white.
5. **Response Time Test**: Check the monitor's response time by displaying a fast-moving image or a video to see if the image appears smooth and free of artifacts.
6. **Viewing Angle Test**: Test the monitor's viewing angle by placing it at an angle and checking if the colors and contrast appear accurate.
7. **Color Accuracy Test**: Use a color accuracy tool like CalMAN or DisplayCAL to measure the monitor's color accuracy and report any errors.
